# HotColdAssemblyCode
This is a small Assembly code program I wrote which can run on Qtspim.
The program prompts the user for a max limit, and a seed, then generates a random number within the max range.
Next the program prompts the user for a input to guess the number, the program will return very cold if not wihtin 25%, cold if not bretween 10%-25% hot if 5%-10% and very hot if within 5% of the numnber generated.
Furthermore, since it would be hard to test on a completely random number I have also provided one with user inputted magic number.
